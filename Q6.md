## Q.6: Program to find Minimum Number of Platforms Required for Trains

Given the arrival and departure times of trains, our task is to determine the minimum number of platforms required so that no train needs to wait.

## Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(N log N)
Sorting both arrival and departure arrays takes the most time.

Space Complexity: O(1)
Only a few variables are used to track platforms and pointers.

## Algorithm:

Minimum platforms required (Arrival[], Departure[]):
Sort both Arrival and Departure time arrays.
Create two pointers:
 i → for arrivals
 j → for departures
Compare arrival[i] and departure[j]:
If a train arrives before or at the same time another train leaves
→ Increase platform count and move arrival pointer (i++)
Else
→ Free a platform and move departure pointer (j++)
Keep updating maximum platforms needed.
Final max value is the answer.

## Example:
Arrivals → {900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800}
Departures → {910, 1120, 1130, 1200, 1900, 2000}

 Output: 3 Platforms Required

 ## JAVA CODE:- 
    import java.util.*;

    public class Train {
    public static int platform(int[] arrival , int [] departure){
        int n = arrival.length;
        Arrays.sort(arrival);
        Arrays.sort(departure);
        int platform = 0, numofplat = 0;
        int arri = 0, depa = 0;
        while (arri < n && depa < n) {
            if (arrival[arri] <= departure[depa]) {
                platform++;
                arri++;
                if (platform > numofplat)
                    numofplat = platform;
            } else {
                platform--;
                depa++;
            }
        }
        return numofplat;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arrival =  {900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800};
        int[] departure = {910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000};

        int result = platform(arrival, departure);
        System.out.println("Minimum platforms required = " + result);
    }
    }
