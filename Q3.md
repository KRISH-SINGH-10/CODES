## Q.3: Program to detect a loop in linked list

A loop in a linked list is a situation where a node points back to a previous node instead of pointing to NULL.
Because of this, traversal can continue forever without reaching the end.

To find such a loop, we use two pointers technique:

One moves one step at a time → Slow pointer

One moves two steps at a time → Fast pointer

## Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(N)
If no loop exists, we eventually reach the end after scanning all nodes

Space Complexity: O(1)
Only two pointers are used

## Algorithm:

Detecting Loop in a Linked List (Using Fast and Slow Pointers)

Start with both pointers pointing to the head node

Move slow pointer by 1 step and fast pointer by 2 steps repeatedly

If at any point both pointers meet → the linked list contains a loop

If fast pointer reaches NULL (end of list) → no loop exists

Example:

Linked List:

10 → 20 → 30 → 40 → 50  
               ↑      ↓  
               70 ←  60


Step-by-Step:

slow = 10, fast = 10

slow = 20, fast = 30

slow = 30, fast = 50

slow = 40, fast = 70

slow = 50, fast = 50

## JAVA CODE:- 
    class Node{
    int data;
    Node1 next;
    Node(int data){
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
    }


    public class Loop_Detection {
    Node1 head;
    public boolean loop(){
        Node1 slow = head;
        Node1 fast = head;
        while(fast!= null && fast.next!= null ){
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if(fast == slow){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Loop_Detection list = new Loop_Detection();
        Node1 n1 = new Node1(10);
        Node1 n2 = new Node1(20);
        Node1 n3 = new Node1(30);
        Node1 n4 = new Node1(40);
        Node1 n5 = new Node1(50);
        Node1 n6 = new Node1(60);
        Node1 n7 = new Node1(70);

        list.head = n1;
        n1.next = n2;
        n2.next = n3;
        n3.next = n4;
        n4.next = n5;
        n5.next = n6;
        n6.next = n7;
        n7.next = n4;

        if(list.loop()){
            System.out.println("LOOP DETECTED");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("LIST FREE OF LOOP");
        }


    }
    }
