## Q.2: Program to Identify the Majority Element in an Array Using Moore’s Voting Algorithm

The Moore Voting Algorithm helps in finding the element that appears more than half the time in a given array.

The majority element must occur more than N/2 times in an array of size N.

## Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(N) — only two linear scans are required

Space Complexity: O(1) — no extra memory is used

## Algorithm:

Assume the first element as the candidate and initialize count = 1.

Traverse through the array:

If the current value matches the candidate → increase count.

If it doesn’t match → decrease count.

If count drops to 0 → update the candidate to the current value and set count to 1.

After the first pass, verify the candidate by counting its occurrences in the array.

If it occurs more than N/2 times → it is the majority element.
Otherwise → no majority element exists.

## Example Explanatio:

Array: 4 4 2 4 3 4 4 1 4

Step-by-step:

Start: candidate = 4, count = 1

Next element is 4 → count = 2

Next is 2 → count = 1

Next is 4 → count = 2

Next is 3 → count = 1

Next is 4 → count = 2

Next is 4 → count = 3

Next is 1 → count = 2

Last 4 → count = 3

Final candidate = 4

Now, count occurrences of 4: it appears 6 times.
Since 6 > (9/2) → 4 is the majority element

## JAVA CODE:- 
    public class MajorityElement {
    public static int voting(int [] arr){
        int candidate = -1;
        int votes = 0;

        // FINDING THE CORRECT CANDIDATE
        for(int num: arr){
            if(votes == 0){
                candidate = num;
                votes = 1;
            } else if (num == candidate) {
                votes++;
            } else {
                votes--;
            }
        }

        // VERIFYING OUR SELECTED CANDIDATE
        votes = 0;
        for(int num: arr){
            if(num == candidate){
                votes++;
            }
        }

        return (votes > arr.length/2 ? candidate : -1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int [] numbers = {4, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4};
        int result = voting(numbers);

        if(result != -1){
            System.out.println("THE MAJORITY ELEMENT OF THE ARRAY IS: " + result);
        } else {
            System.out.println("NO MAJORITY ELEMENT");
        }
    }
    }
