## Q.4: Program to detect the longest consecutive sequence in an array

A consecutive sequence is a set of numbers that appear one after another without any gap.

## Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(N)
We only traverse the array elements once using a set lookup

Space Complexity: O(1)
Only a few variables are required to keep track of lengths

## Algorithm:

 Find the longest chain of consecutive integers in an array:

Put all elements into a HashSet for fast lookup

Set longest sequence length = 0

For each element in the set:
3.1 If (element − 1) does not exist in the set → this can be the start of a sequence
3.2 Count forward (element + 1, element + 2, …) while found in the set
3.3 Update the longest sequence length if this count is greater than the current maximum

Finally, return the longest sequence length

Example:
Array → 4 9 1 3 2 10 20 5 6 7

Consecutive sequence: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Longest length = 7

Output: 7

## JAVA CODE:- 

    import java.util.*;
    public class LongestConsecutiveSequence {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter size of array: ");
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        System.out.println("Enter " + n + " numbers:");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
                    int temp = arr[i];
                    arr[i] = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        int longest = 1;
        int current = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == arr[i - 1] + 1) {
                current++;
            } else if (arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) {
                current = 1;
            }
            if (current > longest) {
                longest = current;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Longest consecutive sequence length is: " + longest);
        sc.close();
    }
    }
